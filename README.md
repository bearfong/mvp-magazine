# Expense

Recording your daily outcome.


# Description

This application is based on an architecture called __*MVP*__ architecture. Actually we don't only practice an
application simply, but also create a base MVP architecture for other projects, too.
We mixed two languages in this project, one is __Kotlin__, the other one is __Java__.

### MVP architecture

We referenced the [Google clean architecture](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp-clean/)
to this application. There are three parts of clean architecture as below.

1. __Presentation Layer__
2. __Domain Layer__
3. __Data Layer__.

### programming language

__*Kotlin*__ in __Presentation Layer__.
<br>
__*Java*__ in __Domain Layer__ and __Data Layer__.


# Third-party library

We're using a lot of Rx family libraries.

1. [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin)
2. [RxBinding](https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding)
3. [RxBus](https://github.com/AndroidKnife/RxBus)
4. [RxLifecycle](https://github.com/trello/RxLifecycle)
5. [KotterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/kotterknife)
6. [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
7. [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
8. [Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger)
